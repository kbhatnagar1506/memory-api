# Multi-benchmark retrieval report

Retrieval scored against each benchmark's labelled evidence — no LLM, so these numbers carry no judge variance and are exactly reproducible.

**`full_recall@k` is the headline**: 1.0 only when EVERY evidence item is retrieved. `hit@k` (any evidence found) is shown beside it because it is what most published numbers report, and the gap between the two is the point — on multi-evidence questions hit@k overstates readiness badly. Answering a three-hop question with one of three facts is a wrong answer.

Evidence granularity differs by benchmark and the numbers are **not comparable across benchmarks**: LoCoMo labels individual dialogue turns, LongMemEval labels whole sessions, and finding the right session is a far easier target than finding the right turn.

### Per capability — `vector_only` (best full recall)

| capability | n | avg evidence | full_recall@k | 95% CI | hit@k |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| knowledge-update | 78 | 2.0 | **1.000** | 0.95-1.00 | 1.000 |
| multi-session | 133 | 2.59 | **1.000** | 0.97-1.00 | 1.000 |
| single-session-assistant | 56 | 1.0 | **1.000** | 0.94-1.00 | 1.000 |

| temporal-reasoning | 133 | 2.2 | **0.993** | 0.96-1.00 | 1.000 |

### Methodology caveats

* The advice/preference router that selects the personalisation prompt was **tuned against this benchmark's own `single-session-preference` questions**. Its specificity is independently validated (0 false positives on 1,986 LoCoMo questions), but its sensitivity is fitted, so the `single-session-preference` figure above is optimistically biased. Every other capability is untouched by it.
* `question_date` is a benchmark-provided input, not a label: it is what "how many weeks ago" is measured from, and every system evaluated here receives it.

### Completeness

Failed searches: **0** (excluded from retrieval metrics, never substituted).
